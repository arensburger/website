  <h1>Introduction to the Arensburger lab</h1>
</header>
<body>
  Welcome to the lab. Here are some general resources that will be useful when you're working on projects. You don't need to know all of this by heart, the purpose is to give you a general sense of what is going on. Look below for topics that are most relevant to your project.
  <h2>Transposable elements</h2>
  Here you'll find here some resources introducing you to the transposable elements (TE), particularly to one type of TE, the DNA transposable elements.
  <ul>
    <li>Video lectures by Dr. Sue Wessler at UC Riverside <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cJfsWYR42M">video 1</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOXvZXtc93U">video 2</a></li>
    <li>Manuscript by Martín Muñoz-López and José L. García-Pérez introducing transposable elements</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Lab communication and record keeping</h2>
  The lab communicates largely via <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>. You'll need me to create you an account. One important reason for this is that communication via Slack keeps a written record of what's been accomplished and how it's been done. When it comes time to publish data, it's very important that good records are kept so everybody knows exactly what's been done.
  <h2>Accessing the lab computers and Linux</h2>
  This lab, and 99% of all bioinformatics lab use the Linux operating systems rather than Window or Mac OS. Partially it's for historical reasons, but it's also because many of the applications designed for bioinformatics run on Linux. There are a variety of different "flavors" of Linux out there, my preference is for Ubuntu, but it's just a preference.
  <h3>Computer Hardware</h3>
  The lab contains several workstations all running Ubuntu. You are welcome to get an account on those workstations and even access them from outside campus (see below). Talk to me if you want to set that up, otherwise (when campus is open), you can come by and work in the lab. In addition to the lab workstations we also have access to the biology computer cluster. This is cluster of high powered computers, used for analysis that is more intense than what can be handled in the lab. If your project needs access to the cluster I can get  you an account, and you can access it from anywhere.
  You can also install Linux on your computer, even alongside Windows. See <a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview">here</a> for some guidance on that.
  <h3>Access the Lab Computer</h3>
  You can access the lab computer (named traviata) via the command line in Windows, MacOS, or a Linux based operating system.
  There are two things you'll need: 1) an account on the traviata computer, 2) the CPP VPN running if you're not on campus. I will provide you a user name and password for traviata, instructions for getting the VPN running on Windows or MacOS are here. Once you have an account and the VPN is running you'll need to use an ssh client program to access traviata from home:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Windows</h4>
      <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html">Putty</a> is a popular ssh client. Install the program and connect to the lab computer by filling in 134.71.67.54 for the host ip. Once connected you'll be asked to enter you user name and password.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Mac</h4>
      You can run an SSH command from the "Terminal" program on a Mac. Run the "Terminal" program, and in the command line type "ssh 134.71.67.54". Once connected you'll be asked to enter your user name and password.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Linux</h4>
      The CPP IT department does not support Linux so they don't provide instructions on how to set up the VPN on a Linux machine. However, it's possible to do, talk to me about it. Once you've got the VPN running, start the program "Terminal" to get the command line interface, and type in "ssh 134.71.67.54" to log into the computer.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Leaning to use Command Lines</h3>
  To communicate with the lab computer, you'll need to use command lines, most of the power of this operating system comes from learning to issue command via the command line. Why? Imagine you want to count the number of times the human genome has the sequence AAATCGC. If you try to open a 3,000,000,000 letter long document in Microsoft Word you'll likely crash your computer. However, issuing the command line below will give you the answer quickly even on a typical laptop computer (provided it runs Linux).<br></br>
  grep -o "AAATCGC" <i>genome_file_name</i> | wc -l<br></br>
  The structure of the command above will take a bit of work to understand, but hopefully you can see how useful command lines can be for bioinformatic work.
  Here's a basic <a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview">tutorial</a> on using a command lines in Ubuntu. It's probably best to work through this tutorial once you have a way to access a Linux based machine.
